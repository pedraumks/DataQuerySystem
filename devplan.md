Learn about REST
	What are endpoints exactly?
	How will the data be transmitted?
Learn about EBNF
Choose a data structure
	Look at what the data will look like
	Approximately how much data will be involved
	Find a data structure that's relatively easy to handle, not incredibly slow
Figure out why being sent in base64 is relevant

Implement saving of data to disk (as zip)
Implement unzipping
Implement loading from disk
Set up basic call/response for REST endpoints to test connection

Create something to parse EBNF (probably its own class)
Create something to parse keys

Vague order:
Basic learning background info first
Figure out data saving/loading
Get basic call/response working
Choose data structure
Implement chosen data structure with example data
Set up search parsing
Set up data querying
Combine to make it work with the REST calls
